# Privacy_evaluation_in_speech

The framework evaluates privacy–utility trade-offs for speech mixed with acoustic scenes (ASC) under sampling-based temporal obfuscation. Privacy leakage is measured using classical ASR metrics, semantic embedding-based metrics, and entity-aware named-entity leakage metrics proposed in the thesis.
